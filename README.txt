WP-Sponsors gives your sponsors or partners a separate home where can add a link and a logo.

== Description ==

WP-Sponsors gives your sponsors or partners a separate home where can add a link and a logo.

Ever had to add a bunch of images with links on them for your event/company partners? With Sponsors, you won't have to use a text widget for that anymore. The companies and people that support you, your company or your event now get a separate place where you can add a link and an image for each of them. Then you add the Sponsors widget to the sidebar of your choosing and the linked images will show up there.

= Upcoming features: =
* Taxonomy - divide your sponsors up in categories and choose which ones to display in which widget
* Weight - Give your sponsors a weight (in their category) to determine how they should be sorted in the widget

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add your sponsors under the sponsors section with links and logo's
